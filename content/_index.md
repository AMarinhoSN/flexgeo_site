# FleXgeo

FleXgeo is a software package design to compute and analyse protein conformational ensembles using a differential geometry (DG) representation of protein backbone. The current available version is the prototype software written to compute all analyses presented at:

> [Silva Neto, AM, Silva, SR, Vendruscolo, M, Camilloni, C, Montalvão, RW. A superposition free method for protein conformational ensemble analyses and local clustering based on a differential geometry representation of backbone. Proteins. 2019; 87: 302– 312](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.25652)

While fully functional, keep in mind that this prototype was written to fulfil the authors own selfish desires. We try our best to make it usable to others outside our group, but for sure there are a lot to improve. If you have any suggestions, feel free to contact Antonio Marinho at `a.marinho@cent.uw.edu.pl`.

Here you can find:

* [A basic usage tutorial](./basic/)
* [Quick command list](./quickguide/)


## Main Features

Currently, FleXgeo is able to:

  * **Compute backbone DG**, compute differential geometry descriptors of protein conformations backbones.
  * **cluster protein conformations**, via global clustering solution per residue based on its curvature and torsion distribution.
  * **quantify protein residues flexibility**, via the computation of $d_{max}$
  * **compare protein conformations to a reference structure**, via the computation of euclidean distances on the curvature and torsion space.

FleXgeo code was written by [PhD. Antonio Marinho da Silva Neto](https://amarinhosn.github.io/) and PhD. Rinaldo Wander Montalvao.

FleXgeo is under development and more features beyond the presented in the paper are planned to be added. If you want to be informed right away when a new feature is added you can *star* [FleXgeo repository on github](https://github.com/AMarinhoSN/FleXgeo) or simply check this page from time to time.
