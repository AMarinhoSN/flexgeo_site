# FleXgeo

FleXgeo is a software package design to compute and analyze a protein conformational ensembles using a differential geometry representation of protein backbone. The current available version is the prototype software written to compute all analyses presented at:

> [â€œA superposition free method for protein conformational ensemble analyses and local clustering based on a differential geometry representation of backbone", PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.25652)

While is fully functional, keep in mind that this prototype was written to fulfill the authors own selfish desires. We try our best to make it usable to others outside our group, but there are a lot to improve on different aspects.


## Main Features

Currently, there are ready to use scripts to:

  * **cluster protein conformations**, via global clustering solution per residue based on its curvature and torsion distribution.
  * **quantify protein residues flexibility**, via the computation of $d_{max}$
  * **compare protein conformations to a reference structure**, via the computation of euclidean distances on the curvature and torsion space.

FleXgeo code was written by [PhD. Antonio Marinho da Silva Neto](https://amarinhosn.github.io/) and PhD. Rinaldo Wander Montalvao.
