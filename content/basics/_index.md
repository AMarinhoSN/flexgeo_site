# First things first

First of all, did you read the FleXgeo paper?
If not, I highly recommend you to check the awesome <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> paper bellow before proceed.

> [â€œA superposition free method for protein conformational ensemble analyses and local clustering based on a differential geometry representation of backbone", PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.25652)

This is a basic tutorial designed to be a quick tour on how to use FleXgeo, to achieve that we will reproduce Ubiquitin analyses presented on the FleXgeo paper.

What FleXgeo can do:

 * **Compute a protein backbone differential geometry descriptors**, via a smooth curve representation of backbones
 * **cluster protein conformations**, via global clustering solution per residue based on its curvature and torsion distribution
 * **quantify protein residues flexibility**, via the computation of $d_{max}$
 * **compare protein conformations to a reference structure**, via the computation of euclidean distances on the curvature and torsion space



Ok, now that you carefully read the paper, we can begin our differential geometry witchcraft.
