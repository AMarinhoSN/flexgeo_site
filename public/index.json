	"content": " On this basic tutorial, we will reproduce the analyses of the Ubiquitin ensemble presented at FleXgeo paper. The Ubiquitin (Ubq) is a good example of a regular rigid globular protein with a flexible C-terminal tail. This is a fairly simple and common analyses scenario on protein structural biology projects, therefore a good place to start. As on any data analyses scenario, before we start to do anything at all let\u0026rsquo;s first understand our general questions, goals and the \u0026ldquo;what/why/how\u0026rdquo; differential geometry can be useful.\nWhat we want to know? Flexibility is an important aspect of protein function and let\u0026rsquo;s assume that for some reason you are interest on Ubq C-terminal tail dynamics. Maybe you found experimental evidence that mutations on this region affects Ubq binding capabilities and want to know how flexible it actually is and which residues are more important.\nWhat data do we have? Fortunately, there is an Ubq conformational ensemble obtained based on NMR-restrained metadynamics available at Protein Data Bank (2LJ5). This ensemble is a set of 300 conformations which together best explain a set of Residual Dipolar Coupling data obtained from experiments. Imagined that you can get the same data from these hypothetical Ubq mutants, this 2LJ5 ensemble can provide a baseline to compare how the tail behave.\nAlthough not necessary to follow this tutorial, you should check the paper describing how this ensemble was obtained.\n The common approach The common approach for this particular problem could be align the conformations and compute the RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation). This will give you some number and you would be able to say something like \u0026ldquo;the C-terminal tail presents X angstroms of RMSF therefore \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, if X is higher than, let\u0026rsquo;s say, 3 angstroms you would conclude that is flexible and use this number as a base line and compare with new data. Note that this hypothetical analyses scenario relies heavily on the decision made on how to superimpose the structure. For instance, if only the first three residues of the tail were used for the alignment and one just rely on the values of RMSF to judge flexibility, RMSF would suggest that the whole protein is very flexible with the exception of those 3 residues. Of course, this is an absurd example and only someone that does not understand what the RMSF quantity means would came to such conclusions, but you would be surprise on how often similar misinterpretation can happen on less obvious cases.\nImagined that you try different superposition solution for this Ubq C-terminal tail, but you are not confident that those RMSFs values are meaningful. Then you realize you will have to compare it with new data for the mutations and small differences in the superposition solution could be a problem during the interpretation. This problem is true for atomic coordinates, but there is also the possibility of use $\\phi-\\psi$ angles or define some set of collective variables. Each of those options have some limitations, some of them were discussed in the FleXgeo paper, but for this tutorial let\u0026rsquo;s assume you try those and for some reason did not trust the results. Maybe you are not sure if your collective variables are capturing the fundamental dynamics aspect, the periodicity of $\\phi-\\psi$ are making things more complicated in the data analyses or you simply would like to look at your data from a different perspective analyses. Like any normal regular human being, you find yourself thinking during the day:\n \u0026ldquo;The world would be much better if we have an intuitive mathematical representation of the protein conformational space\u0026rdquo;.\n Some friend told you about hearing some crazy rumour about some ancient protein differential geometry witchcraft that avoid the structural superposition problem. You google a bit, you check some awesome papers describing it and find out that this mathematical representation may help you solve your problem. Then you find that there is this FleXgeo software you can use to compute it and is convinced that you should at least give it a try.\nWhat is the logic behind this DG representation? The rationale behind DG-representation implemented on FleXgeo is quite simple:\n One can represent protein backbones as regular 3D spatial curves Regular 3D patial curves can be uniquely characterized by curvature, $\\kappa$, and torsion, $\\tau$ as a function of arc-length, $s$ $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ can be used to compare regular 3D spatial curves.  Considering 1), 2) and 3), therefore\n Protein backbones can be compared solely based on $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ values.\n How this DG witchcraft avoids the superposition problem? In a nutshell, the DG-based representation of protein backbone have the advantage of avoiding the superposition problem because the descriptors are absolute in space. This specific property rely on the Fundamental Theorem of Space Curves, which state that every regular spatial 3D-curve can be uniquely characterized by its curvature, $\\kappa$, and $\\tau$ as a function of arc length, $s$. The mathematical proof of this theorem is not trivial, however its meaning is intuitive. Imagine that one have two equal semi-rigid straight wires. Only two kind of distortions are possible to be imposed on such wires, 1) to curve it and/or 2) to torsion it in a given set of points. If wire $A$ get a specific sequence of distortions operations and this exact same operations is also applied to wire $B$, both wires will end up with the exact same final shape. Therefore, one could compare such wires just by analysing the specific set of distortion applied to each one, without the need to superimpose such wires.\nAnother way to look into this representation is to think how geometry tends to represent shapes using the minimum amount of descriptors as possible. For instance, circles can be describe solely by its radius, if two circles have different radius you know which one is bigger than the other without the need to superimposition. Similarly, 3D spatial curves can be uniquely specified by $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ as a function of $s$. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if all of this sounds too abstract for you, along this tutorial we will present in a (hopefully) intuitive and easy to understand way what all of this actually means and how to interpret its meaning on the structural biology analyses context.\nNow that you have a at least general notion of what this representation is all about, we can define our goals.\nA more detailed description of the math behind the method is available at FleXgeo paper, but a section devoted for the math-hardcore structural biologist (that we know you are) will be added to the website in the future.\n Main goal Characterize and explore backbone dynamics of the C-terminal tail of Ubiquitin using differential geometry.\nSpecific goals  Compute differential geometry representation Plot the raw data Compute $d_{max}$ to quantify protein flexibility Check if there is an interesting clustering solution (SPOILER ALERT: there is not, but is nice to know how to do it)  "

	"content": " Now we have the data computed, so the first thing to do is check how it looks like. You can plot the data from \u0026lsquo;Diffgeo_xgeo.csv\u0026rsquo; using any software or script you like, but on FleXgeo you find a script to generate some plots and you can run it using:\n$ python3 /path/to/FleXgeo/PlotFXgeoData.py DiffGeo_xgeo.csv  This script will generate the plot bellow\nSo what does that mean? The plot might be not very informative at first glance, but to interpret it first we need to understand the meaning of curvature, $\\kappa$, and torsion, $\\tau$, values. The wikipedia article on differential geometry of spatial curves is a very decent introduction which also include the mathematics behind it and you should check it, but for this tutorial let\u0026rsquo;s try to keep it brief and simple. To understand what $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ actually means, first we need to understand how such quantities are defined and they are defined based on the framing of a curve.\nframing of a curve The framing of a curve means we need to define a set of vectors that can be computed for each point along the regular spatial curve, $r$, and by monitoring how such set of vectors changes along such curve characterize its shape. The \u0026lsquo;along the curve\u0026rsquo; part can be more objectively specified by the arc-length, $s$, as $r$ is just a function that map some values on the interval $I$, we can parametrize $\\vec{r}$ as a function of $s$ or, as mathematicians like to call it, $$ r : I \\rightarrow R^{3} $$ $$\\vec{r}(s) : I \\rightarrow R^{3}$$.\nThe standard choice for framing a curve is to use the frenet-serret frame, which defines 3 unit vectors: tangent ($\\vec{T}$), normal($\\vec{N}$) and binormal($\\vec{B}$) unit vectors). If the analysed curve, $\\vec{r}(s)$ represents a particle trajectory, the tangent vector will always point in the direction of the motion of the particle and the binormal vector would always point in the \u0026ldquo;up\u0026rdquo; direction from the particle frame of reference, check the animation.\nNow imagine that this particle just move in a straight line trajectory without any rotational motion. For such case the, $\\vec{T}$ and $\\vec{B}$ will be constant. On the other hand, if the particle moves on a non straight line trajectory but keep in the exact same plane, $\\vec{T}$ will change while $d\\vec{B}$ will still be constant. Considering these features, is possible tu use $\\vec{T}$ and $\\vec{B}$ to define quantities that measures how much a given point in a curve deviates from a straight line and from a plane.\ndefining $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ Let\u0026rsquo;s first start with curvature, $\\kappa$. We can define $\\kappa$ as a measurement of how much a point in a given curve deviates from straight line by considering as a measurement of how much $\\vec{T}$ changes along the curve by: $$ \\kappa = | \\vec{\\kappa}(s) | = | \\frac{d\\vec{T}}{ds} | $$\nif $\\kappa = 0$ for a given point $t$, then the curve will be a perfect straight line at $t$. As higher the $\\kappa$ values, the higher will be the change of $\\vec{T}$ at the vicinity of $t$. Therefore, if a $\\kappa$ spike at point $t$ appears in your curve, this means that at point $t$ there is a abrupt change in the direction of the curve. Similarly, the same rationale can be applied to planes by defining the Torsion, $\\tau$, as $$ \\tau = | \\vec{\\tau} | = | \\frac{d\\vec{B}}{ds} | $$\nIf a $\\tau$ spike at point $t$ appears in your curve, this means that at point $t$ there is an abrupt change in the plane in the vicinity of $t$. With those to descriptors one can uniquely characterize any 3D regular curve via $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ as a function of $s$. For instance, check how the $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ values of a Torus knots relate to its Frenet-Serret frame in the animation bellow.\nWith that in mind you should be able to look to the plot generated and have an idea of what it means.\nWhat about the plot? The plot generate express the $\\kappa$ and $\\tau$ values per residue $t$ for all conformations of the ensemble. Each line of the plot is the representation of a single conformation and how much a residue change its \u0026ldquo;signature\u0026rdquo; give you an idea of its flexibility and what is happening. For instance, just by looking at the plot you can claim that residues 24 to 34 are a stable helix, that the last residues are more flexible and the region around residue 10 present a higher flexibility than the rest of the protein and residues 36 and 60 are stable points of inflection in the backbone. Look at the ensemble on Pymol and check if our interpretation make sense ;).\n"
